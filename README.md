Receipt Buying App

Developer Information

Developer ID: 22B030505
App Name: Receipt Buying App

Project Overview

The Receipt Buying App is an iOS application designed to facilitate the purchase and management of receipts. This app serves as a demonstration of core iOS development skills, including user interface design, networking, and data storage, while adhering to best practices in coding and layout design.

Features

1. Basic UI Components

UILabel: Display static and dynamic text to users.

UIImageView: Show images related to receipts and transactions.

UIButton: Provide interactive elements for navigation and actions.

UITextField and UITextView: Enable users to input data, such as receipt details.

UISwitch, UISlider, UISegmentedControl: Additional interactive elements for customization.

2. Auto Layout with Storyboards

All screens are designed using Storyboards.

Auto Layout constraints ensure responsiveness on all screen sizes and orientations.

Stack Views are used for simplified and consistent layouts.

3. UITableView/UICollectionView with Custom Cells

A UITableView displays a list of receipts.

Custom cells include receipt-specific data such as title, date, and amount.

Dynamic data loading and cell reuse ensure smooth performance.

4. Multi-Module Application Structure

A UITabBarController organizes the app into distinct modules:

Home: Overview of receipts.

Add Receipt: Form to input new receipt details.

Settings: Manage preferences and app configurations.

A UINavigationController facilitates navigation within modules.

5. Networking (URLSession or Alamofire)

URLSession is used for networking tasks:

Fetching receipt data from a public API.

Uploading receipt information to a server.

JSON parsing maps responses to the app’s data models.

Graceful error handling provides user feedback during network issues.

6. Local Data Storage

UserDefaults: Stores user preferences, such as default currency and theme.

Core Data: Manages receipt details for offline access.

7. Additional Recommended Features

Error Handling: Informative error messages guide users during issues.

Loading Indicators: Display activity indicators during network requests.

Pull to Refresh: Allows users to refresh receipt lists manually.

Pagination: Efficiently loads large datasets in smaller chunks.

Search Functionality: Enables users to search receipts by name or date.

8. User Experience Enhancements

Basic animations improve user interactions.

Intuitive and visually appealing interface adheres to modern design standards.

9. Code Quality and Testing

Clean, maintainable code follows Swift best practices.

Comprehensive comments explain complex logic.

Unit tests using XCTest verify the functionality of critical components.
